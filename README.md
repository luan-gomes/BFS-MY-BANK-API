# BFS-MY-BANK-API

 This is the My Bank API. An REST API developed during IGTI's Bootcamp Full Stack in order to simulate an API from a bank that registers a user's name and balance.
 
 The My Bank API was built in Node.js using the Express framework and libraries such as winston, cors and swagger-ui-express.
